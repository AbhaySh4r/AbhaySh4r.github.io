This project was inspired by the recent sonification of the Perseus Galaxy Cluster, which led to many conversations behind the production of the project. 

The focus was on building the foundation for sonification of stellar objects, where selection of tone is relatively arbitrary in this execution, does allow for a more robust method to be dropped into the already functioning project.
