Hi there,

My name is Abhay Sharma. Currently a student at the MSDS Program at SMU. I've previously completed a BS in Astrophysics, and currently looking at large scale data projects and implementations of Data Science in the world of Astronomy/Astrophysics. 

I enjoy making music, having choice paralysis, and playing Tennis. 

Reach out at my email!
