  subHeading: Data Science Graduate interested in the intersection of Physics and ML
  content: >
    I recently graduated from SMU's Master's in Data Science program. Prior to SMU, I graduated from UCI with a Bachelor's degree in Physics. During my time at SMU, I've gained hands on experience with various ML modelling techniques bolstered with my mathematical foundations to build a comprehensive understanding of the field. For my Master's capstone project, I collaborated and published a paper with Microsoft on a project that delved deep into the application of Deep Learning and utility of LLMs in a real world problem. I'm currently looking for opportunitise to apply my skills and passion to the field of Physics and ML.
